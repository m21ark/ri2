## How to Run

### Script

Run the command to startup all needed services and then close them with CTRL+C:

```
> bash setup.sh
```

### Manual approach

- Open 3 terminals, and in 2 of them run the following commands:

```
> rcssserver3d
> cd src/robotViz/bin && sh roboviz.sh
```


- The last command is the script of what you want to run. A possibility is:

```
> python3 src/Run_One_vs_One.py 
```
